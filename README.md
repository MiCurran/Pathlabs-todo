# Pathlabs - TypeScript To-Do App

## Prompt

```
- Build a front-end application showing a working to-do app
    - This doesn't need any backend or data persistence. Use a datastore on the front-end (eg, redux, or localstorage)
    - it should show how a simple to-do app could work
eg. SPA where I can add, edit update, complete and delete a to-do list
```

## Setup

### First, install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Next run the dev server

```bash
npm start
```
